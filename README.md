# Decrypting Subsitution Ciphers using Genetic Algorithms
> This program can possibly decrypt substitution ciphers. The ```encipher.cpp``` enciphers a plain text with a random key. The ```decrypting_substitution_ciphers.cpp``` possibly decrypts the cipher text using genetics algorithm. A traing text file needs to be provided to this.
